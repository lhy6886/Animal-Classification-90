# 🤖 Help Every CS Freshman Have Your First AI！ (Windows only)

> I’m a CS freshman crazy about AI 🤖.  
> This repo walks you **step-by-step** from training a 2-class (cats vs dogs) model to a **90-class animal recognizer**,  
> then **porting it to Android**—all explained without the jargon!

🧭 Roadmap

1. Cats & Dogs 🐶🐱  – 2 000 images, get > 90 % accuracy.  
2. 90 Animals 🦒🐘    – scale to 90 species, same tricks.  
3. Android 📱        – convert to `.tflite`, drop into an Android app.
